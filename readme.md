Usage
The AI Toolbox provides various classes and functions for different tasks. Here's an overview of the main components:

FileSystem: Perform file system operations such as creating, deleting, renaming, moving, and copying files.

ModelZoo: Manage machine learning models, train models, and make predictions.

APIOperations: Perform HTTP GET and POST requests to interact with APIs.

NonMLAPIOperations: Perform non-machine learning related API calls.

NLPOperations: Perform natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and text tokenization.

ContentConverter: Convert between different content formats such as text to image, audio to text, and text to audio.

DatasetManager: Load, save, preprocess, combine, split, and synthesize datasets.

DocumentVectorizer: Embed documents and find similar documents using vectorization techniques.

CodeGenerator: Generate code snippets in different programming languages.

ToolLibrary: Perform various string, numerical, and file operations.

You can use the provided classes and functions by creating instances of the respective classes and invoking the relevant methods.

Components
The AI Toolbox consists of the following components:

FileSystem: This class provides methods for creating, deleting, renaming, moving, and copying files. You can also update file permissions using this class.
